# Frugal Thinker 

Frugal Thinker is my digital sanctuary where I chart the journey of my thoughts, finances, fitness journey, and the everyday victories that make life unique. Here, I lay it all bareâ€”no filters, no pretense, just the raw and real me. I believe in transparency, in being candid about life's ups and downs, and in sharing the lessons learned along the way. 

## About The Project

I built this project using Astro; which as been one of the best developer experiences I've had in years. Everything is fast, easy to learn and pushes your creative boundaries. I fell in love with bentno-grids and used the same design principle in the front-end leveraging tailwind. The database is sqlite. 
The "Tiny Stack" published by Shayan inspired the development:https://logsnag.com/blog/the-tiny-stack
